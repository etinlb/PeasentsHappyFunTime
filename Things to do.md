#Things to do

##Movement
- Occupy more than one grid square
- Be able to move a collective group

##Engine
- Have debug menu (could just be a tacked on html at the bottom) to make spawning certain units easier.
  - If possible, make it fancy as fuck, allowing components to be added automatically, any property to be editable by 
    on any object. 
  - Able to control speed of the game to. 

##Units
- Get an attack unit down
  - be able to attack a building at first
  - attack move as well, move to a place and attack anything it can see along the way.
- Get a simple ai down. 
  - Target buildings
  - Target player units
- More units
  - Need more units for everything

##Buildings
- Simple building that produces attack units
- Walls

##Mouse/Interface
- De select units
- Ctrl click to add units
- Select buildings

##Refactor
- ~~Restructure components~~
  - ~~The attack unit is doing way to much and doesn't even attack!~~
